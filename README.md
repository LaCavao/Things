Everything's a Thing

Automatically convert Pydantic models into schemas:

- GBNF grammars for constrained sampling in llama.cpp
    - Easy extension to other grammar formats by providing type rules...
    - ...see the EBNF example (haven't evaluated these outside GBNF)
- Semantic schemas for use in prompting (including field descriptions where provided)

This module is minimal; it doesn't touch the inference process, and that is very intentional.
It is purely concerned with the representation of data.
